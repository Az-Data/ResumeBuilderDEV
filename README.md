# ResumeBuilderDEV
We will be attempting to productionise this ResumeBuilder Idea. 


There were some errors trying to run langchain due to packages not at the right version.
To resolve

pip install typing-inspect==0.8.0 typing_extensions==4.5.0 pydantic==1.10.11

(which I got from here
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76313592/import-langchain-error-typeerror-issubclass-arg-1-must-be-a-class)

Hopefully that fixes it.
